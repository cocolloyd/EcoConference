			<h3>Welcome</h3>
			<p>Eco DC is the first conference intersecting design with climate issues. It will be held in April 2020, the weekend before Earth Day.</p>
			<p>Our goal is simple. We aim to empower designers to be the change we need in a world galvanized to action on environmental issues. From effective visual communication that empowers individuals to how the design process itself can be changed, this conference will give you new ideas on sustainable practices.</p>
			<p>We hope you will come in with an open mind and your own creative solutions on how you can impact your community and give back to the earth. See you there!</p>

			<h3>Ripple of Change</h3>
			<p>The conference focuses on the central message of designers being a ripple for change. As Tim Cook once said, "you want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the ripple for change". Our conference wants to recognize the feats that designers and individuals accomplish each day to make a better world. We also want to instill the passion and ideas that design and environment can come together. Design looks at visual communication and enhances how society interacts with the world around them. So why not take that a step further and make sure that we keep sustainability and environmental concerns in mind?</p>
			<p>This is why we want designers and emerging leaders like yourself to take that small step. Be the one that starts a wave of change. Be the one that stands out in a crowd and stand for what you believe in. We need people like you to answer the environmental challenges the world is -- and will -- be facing.</p>
