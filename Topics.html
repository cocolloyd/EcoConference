			<p>Take a look at the current environmentally related graphic design issues and sustainability topics that designers around the world are addressing. These topics will be touched upon during conference weekend</p>

			<h3 class="subheader">Communicating Messages</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="ht1">
			<h4>Visually Compelling Graphics</h4>
			<p>Designers can create images and graphics that speak louder than words when it comes to voicing issues in climate change. Below is a gallery of some of the top climate graphics of 2019.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="ht11">
			<h4>Visualize the Problem</h4>
			<p>How do you approach a design problem? Those same questions and processes -- research, analysis, etc. -- can be applied to create a cohesive environmental campaign or message.<p>
		</div>

		<div class="section2">
			<h3 class="subheader">Soil: Creating Natural Design</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="ht2">
			<h4>Cardboard vs. Soil Erosion</h4>
			<p>Ecosystem Kickstarter (Ecokick) biodegrades its products such as cardboard, and when it does it grows a strip of "perennial terracing vegetation" due to the nutrient rich cardboard. These terraced crops fulfill the same stabilizing function that cardboard originally served. In between these organic fortifications, food crops are prtoected form erosion and able to flourish. Ultimately, this could break the vicious cycle of soil erosion, which is exacerbated by climate change as long periods of drought followed by brief, torrential rainfall.

		<div class="ht21">
			<h4>An Eroding society</h4>
			<p>Soil erosion is the displacement of the top layer of soil in some sort of natural degradation, usually caused by erosive elements such as water, ice, humans, animals, etc. While it is natural, too much soil erosion (resulting from overuse) reduces the nutrients needed for agriculture. Farmers end up with lower yields and high production costs. Soil erosion also causes unstable grounds, making cities and lands vulnerable, particularly to natural disasters.</p>

			<h3 class="subheader">Fast Fashion</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="h3image">

		<div class="ht3">
			<h4>Music in Style</h4>
			<p>Benjamin Benmoyal made big moves in the fashion industry with his collection of utopian garments that were hand-woven from fabrics made of recycled cassette tapes. The collection, titled "It Was Better Tomorrow", was created on Benmoyal's desire to feel less pessimistic about the world. His unique materials give a colorful and glossy look. His collection has inspired other designers to repurpose other common yet unconventional materials.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ht31">
			<h4>Fast Fashion Industry</h4>
			<p>Fast fashion has become a viable option in making clothes affordable. However, it has negative environmental impacts due to all the waste it produces. Nearly 85% of al textiles enter the dump. Aside from waste, washing these clothes also release toxic dyes and microfibers into waterways. To top it off, the labor and factories needed account for about 10% of the world's carbon emissions. So while a cute shirt may seem harmless, its impact runs deep.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section4">
			<h3 class="subheader">Clean Web Design</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="ht4">
			<h4>Wiping Footprints</h4>
			<p>Design can have a lot of waste. Fortunately, some companies are working to turn this around. Wipro EcoEnergy acts as a consulting design company that helps other companies reduce their carbon footprints and energy wastes. This not only saves the company money, but also gives them a cleaner look. Wipro works behind the scenes and allows for the visual cleanliness to speak for itself.

			<h4>Impressionable and Invisible</h4>
			<p>The online world has an undeniably large carbon footprint, and it is undetected since we use electronics, technology, and cloud storage daily. The Internet that powers this has impacts that spread into manufacturing and powering. A lot of the impact is difficult to change since it is generated from fossil fuels, but designers can at least make the push to move away from combustible fuels into an online system that runs off of clean energy and emits less.</p>
